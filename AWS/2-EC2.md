> Example of scheduled RI: You have EOFY sale and need extra capacity, so you reserve instances every July every year.

![ec2-5](./img/ec2-5.PNG)

> Pharmaceutical and Genomics companies would use Spot Instances for heavy computing capacity at the cheapest times (because when these workloads are run is not important).

> You don't need to memorize this for Associate level exams! You do need to recognize what the short names stand for though - as you need to know what are valid instance types.

> EC2 can be thought of as a virtual server in the cloud, EBS is a virtual disk.

> If you see an exam question about an application that needs less than 10,000 IOPS, then GP2 (i.e. general purpose SSD) is the best choice, as it balances both performance and price.

## Elastic Load Balancer

![ec2-16](./img/ec2-16.PNG)

- **Application Load Balancer:** Very intelligent load balancer that can operate up to to the application layer of the OSI model. Example, if requests are for sales, it will route packets to the sales application server (and so on).

- **Network Load Balancer**: The most expensive AWS load balancer. Used for performance, required for production servers. Works on the TCP/IP layer.

- **Classic Load Balancer:** There for legacy reasons, not recommended - however AWS exams tend to test you on this.

![ec2-18](./img/ec2-18.PNG)

![ec2-18](./img/ec2-19.PNG)

> With **Classic Load Balancers**, if the application stops responding, the ELB (classic load balancer) responds with a 504 error (gateway timeout). **This means the application is having an issue (not the load balancer) by not responding within the idle timeout period.**

### X-Forwarded-For Header

![ec2-20](./img/ec2-20.PNG)

> The client request is intercepted by the load balancer and forwarded to your EC2 instance - the load balancer and instances reside in a private network, so the forwarded request will have the internal IP. **So if you want the original client IP, just check the X-Forwarded-For header.**

## Route 53

Route 53 allows you to buy a domain name.

## AWS CLI Reference

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/index.html

When you use **Amazon Linux**, it's an optimized version of Linux for EC2 and with the Amazon CLI pre-installed.

### Exam Tips

- **Least privilege:** Always give the bare minimum amount of access required to users.
- **Create Groups:** Always assign users to groups (so create one if one doesn't exist). Group permissions are assigned using policy documents.

> **People have written scripts to scan github for access keys**

![ec2-23](./img/ec2-23.PNG)

![ec2-24](./img/ec2-24.PNG)

> Roles are easier to manage over access keys, as roles are global and access keys are on a per developer basis.

> In the exam, if you were given a scenario to choose between access keys and roles, choose roles.

## Elastic Block Store

### Attaching an EBS volume to an instance

- When you create a new EBS Volume, you can encrypt it. If the volume is created from a snapshot, the new volume will be **automatically encrypted** based on whether the snapshot is encrypted or not. If you aren't creating from a snapshot, you can choose whether the new volume is encrypted or not.
- In order to attach a volume to an instance, they both must reside in the **same region**.

1. To view volumes on your instance:

> `lsblk`

2. To check if the volume has no filesystem:

> `file -s /dev/<name-of-vol>`

The output would just say `data`

3. To create a filesystem (of type ext4):

> `mkfs -t ext4 /dev/<name-of-vol>`

![ec2-25](./img/ec2-25.PNG)

4. The final step is to create a mount point, that attaches a folder to the new volume.

> `mkdir filesystem`

> `mount /dev/<name-of-vol> /filesystem`

5. To unmount:

> `umount -d /dev/<name-of-vol>`

6. To create a snapshot

### Encrypting an existing Root Device Volume

One option is to simply use the OS feature (such as Bitlocker for Windows). However an easier way of doing it is to:

1. Create a snapshot of the root device volume.
2. Copy the snapshot, and select "Encrypt this snapshot".
3. Create an image of the encrypted snapshot.
4. Go to "AMIs" and launch the image. **Encrypted root device images are a paid feature, so don't actually launch!**

### Exam tips

## Relational Database Services (RDS)

![ec2-27](./img/ec2-27.PNG)

> Aurora is Amazon's own RDB, it's fully compatible with MySQL and Postgres.

> Redshift is Amazon's OLAP service.

![ec2-28](./img/ec2-28.PNG)

> A popular exam question is what strategies you could use to improve database performance - using Elasticache is an excellent option.

### RDS Backups

![ec2-29](./img/ec2-29.PNG)

![ec2-30](./img/ec2-30.PNG)

> You define your backup window on RDS create (or you can edit the default later).

![ec2-31](./img/ec2-31.PNG)

![ec2-31](./img/ec2-32.PNG)

> Your restored backup is an entirely new database instance!

![ec2-31](./img/ec2-33.PNG)

### Multi-AZ

![ec2-34](./img/ec2-34.PNG)

When an instance makes a write to us-east1b, that write is replicated to another instance in us-east-1c. This is for disaster recovery. If the primary instance (us-east-1b), goes down, Amazon will detect it and update the DNS of that primary instance to point to us-east-1c.

> Remember, you never deal with IP addresses for databases, only with a DNS which automatically fails over to the backup.

![ec2-35](./img/ec2-35.PNG)

> **Important:** Multi-AZ RDS is _only_ for disaster recovery. It is not for performance. For performance improvement, you need **Read Replicas**.

> You can turn off/on Multi-AZ deployment, as this won't be necessary for test/dev databases.

### Read Replicas

- This an example of scaling out your database.
- In general, reads are more common than writes.
- So one way to improve performance is to have your reads done on replicas rather than the production database.
- You can have read replicas of replicas.
- You can have read replicas in different availability zones or even regions.
- Not available for Oracle or SQL Server.

### Elasticache exam tips

![ec2-46](./img/ec2-46.PNG)

> If it's an OLAP/Datawarehouse question, it's Redshift, if it's about alleviating stress off a read heavy database, it's Elasticache.
