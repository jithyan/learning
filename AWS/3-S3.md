# S3

- Stands for **S**imple **S**torage **S**ervice.
- Secure, durable and scalable **object** storage. By object, you mean things like files and images, not operating systems and databases.

### Notes from Lab

- Blocking all public accesss is the default, and is the recommended practice.
- Enabling **Bucket Versioning** means every object you modify will have a different version. So if you accidentally delete it, you can retrieve it.
- **Object Locking** is a **W**rite **O**nce **R**ead **M**any model, which prevents object from being modified for a _fixed or indefinite_ amount of time. Object locking is only available in versioned buckets.
- You can create folders within buckets to organize your files.
- When you upload a file, you can click on it to get to a full-screen info page. You can open it via the "Object actions" menu. Another way of opening it is via a generated link - but that link won't work unless you enable public access for that file.

> You won't be able to upload a publicly accessible file unless it's your bucket's policy.

> If you update your bucket's policy, the existing objects won't be affected until you update the policy of the object.

- When you edit a bucket's policy (via permissions), use the policy generator. The principal is a someone like a user, which you can grab from IAM.

### S3 Encryption

![s3-11](./img/s3-11.PNG)

- **S3 Managed Keys**: Each object is encrypted using strong multi-factor encryption (AES-256). As an additional security step, AWS encryptes the keys using a master key, which they regularly rotate for you.
- **SSE-KMS** (Server Side Encryption Key Management Service): You get an additional permission to use an **envelope key**, which is a key that encrypts your data's encryption key as an added security measure. You also get an audit trail for your keys - when it has been used, who used it and why. This gives you a view of all encryption/decryption activities in your S3 bucket. You can use your own key or an AWS generated key which is unique to you.
- **SSE-C**: AWS manages all the encryption and decryption activities but you manage your own keys.
- **Client side encryption:** You encrypt your files before uploading it.

- Expect 100 continue: means that don't upload until AWS acknowledges your HEADER. If AWS rejects your header, you file won't be uploaded.

### Lab notes

1. Go to S3, create a new bucket. If you enable SSE, you can choose betweem Managed Keys and KMS.
2. If you want to setup a bucket policy instead, you create the bucket, go to the bucket -> permissions -> polcies -> edit.
3. Go to the policy generator and do the following:
   - Create an `S3 Bucket Policy`
   - Set the Effect to `Deny`
   - Principal to `*` (so it affects all requests)
   - Actions to `PutObject`
   - ARN to the name of the bucket
   - Add a condition
   - `StringNotEqual`
   - Key is `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption`
   - Value is `aws:kms`
4. **This is important**: you will see an error once you try to save your generated policy. This is because AWS doesn't like you applying a policy to a specific resource. This can be fixed by appending a wildcard to your **resource name** - so simply append `/*` to your resource name.
5. Now when you try to upload a file via AWS console to your bucket, unless you explicitly enable SSR on upload, the upload will fail.
6. To upload a file, you need to enable SSE - AWS KMS upon upload. Note if you use the other method - S3 Managed Key, it will be rejected.
