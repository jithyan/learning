# VS Code Tips

## UI Organization

- You can drag open files on to a "grid" in the main view that allows you to place them in any configuration (2 column, 4x4, etc).
- If you want to see a currently open file in another "group", i.e. to see the same file side-by-side, use `CTRL + \` while in an open file.

## Files

- If you type, for e.g. `src/app/app.js`, it will create the directories for you if they don't already exist.
